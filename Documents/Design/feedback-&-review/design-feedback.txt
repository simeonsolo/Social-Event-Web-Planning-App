Design Feedback

    Review 1
        Layout makes sense, the buttons are where I expect them
        some diffrences in buttons could be benificial to distinguish options from one another
        It's not immediately obvious when i'm logged in vs when i'm not

        Header is not consistent between main and other pages
        header button design changes between pages
        looks good visually
        love the logo

    Changes to implement as a result of the review.
        Add color to the 'sign up' button to make it stand out for a new user, potentially make it larger than the adjascent button.
        Make the header design consistent across all pages. Fill to top of page looks better.
        Add account information to the 'my account' button to improve visability of being logged in. Maybe user name or abbreviation.
        Make the menu buttons consistent between pages.
